General Information
===================

Vibe contains libraries with missing features from Qt.
Some of the classes here are Maui and Hawaii specific, however some others are not
and the plan is to push what can be used by other projects to Qt.

=======

Vibe uses CMake and install the files into GNU-style installation directories.
To build the code create a separate build/ directory and run cmake from there,
for example:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..

The default prefix is /usr/local, in order to install on a different path, for
example /usr, run cmake as reported below:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..

Under Maui you have to run cmake as follows:

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/system -DCMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR=develop/headers ..
